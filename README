Plate normalization tool, using median polishing and similar
techniques.  Reads Excel (and eventually INCell XML files).  Will call
hits for RNAi experiments using the median-of-medians rule (median of
replicates, median of RNAis targeted to a particular gene).

GUI and command line modes will be supported.

Will also produce sufficient documentation for reproducible research
(revision information, normalization parameters, input file).
